This is a really neat project I found that's using a new modern programming language called zig. 

I have known about zig for a while now, but what's interesting about any new programming language is the malware that can be created with it. 

Since this programming language is new it is hard to reverse engineer it like typical C++ code and that's what it makes it exciting.

Not only that zig itself is close syntactically to C++ make it easier for C++ and malware devs alike to start looking into it. 

The other interesting thing is that zig can interface with C++ libraries. 

I'd like to see some interesting stuff come out of this programming language for malware.
