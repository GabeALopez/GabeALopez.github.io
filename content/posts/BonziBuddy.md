## Intro

If you are like many you might be asking what the heck BonziBuddy is. Well to put it simply it was one of the virtual assistants that was created back in the day of Windows XP to help out with everyday office tasks. Many virtual assistants like BonziBuddy were created at the time since many users did not like current default implementation from Microsoft's virtual assistant named clippy. Because of this many people created many differing virtual assistants that had extended upon what clippy could do. One of these virtual assistants was named BonziBuddy along with his predecessor Peedy, made from a company named Bonzi. BonziBudder was made to help with pretty much everything that a user could do, however it wasn't really all that helpful. Though many people did like the way it had talked and thus started getting a name for itself. At the time the speech engine that Bonzi had used for BonziBuddy was a new thing to people and thus was a nice novelty[^1].

## Diving Deeper

Now besides BonziBuddy being able to read emails and just keep calendar events, it also had another feature to it. This feature was promoting Bonzi's other software in the form of windows alerts which was quite deceptive to users. The company had also advertised to make your internet connection faster by changing some configurations which were dubious at best. Furthermore the ads that BonziBuddy did show as well had fake 'X' that didn't close the ads but lead you to their company's site.

The interesting thing about this is that the company was actually getting class action lawsuits for this deceptive practice along with fighting with the FTC for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The company was found violating by pulling up registration forms asking for information like names, addresses, and ages.

Here is an image of the registration form:

Over time the company started to get more aggressive by forcing the web browser to default to the Bonzai web page and install toolbars in Internet Explorer.

## Legacy

Though besides all of the things that BonziBuddy was created to do, many people still remember fondly of the purple monkey. Even to this day there are mirrors of the original Bonzi site. And even beyond people have actually still have the original application for BonziBuddy that is still available for download to this day. If you are interested you can find on the internet somewhere to get the download and try it out yourself. This article is not going to have the link just in case it gets in trouble :). Liability and all that. 

Nowadays many people do not remember BonziBuddy but there is a game that is actually created in the spirit of the old malware called knitopet which is actually available on Steam if you are interested in it. That I will put a link for [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2075070/KinitoPET/)
