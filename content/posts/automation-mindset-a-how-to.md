# Introduction 

Welcome! Welcome! Traveler I see you wish to hear about the greatness of automation! That's good news. Well? Shall we begin? What is automation? I know I know you didn't come here for a history lesson. Neither did I but this is to give you context to everything I will say. So don't click away just yet. You hear me!?

Anyway automation, in todayâ€™s digital workflows, means using technology to handle repetitive tasks automatically. Instead of doing things like sending emails, moving files, or entering data by hand, software tools do it for you. Yep those last two sentences where straight from ChatGPT! But it gets that point across. What's that? You want human responses now? *sigh* fine. The things I have to do to please these people I swear. But anyway, why is this important? Automation is important because you don't want to do the same BS over and over again! But scientifically, it helps to reduce errors and save time. 

See. It wasn't going to be that long. Anyway, how can you start to thinking automation in your day to day life? Or maybe in your workplace? Or maybe in your own company?
