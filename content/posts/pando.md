Was made aware of a tree a few days ago by a friend. It is called Pando. It is apparently the world's largest tree. 

Here is a picture of it here:

It a tree that is located in Utah in the Fishlake National Forest and wasn't realy recognized as a tree until 1976 when it rediscovered in a sense by two [ecologists][1]. It's pretty cool to look at when you see in the Fall too, when its leaves change to a bright almost yellow-orange color.

Here is an image of Pando during fall:

The interesting thing about it to is that is that it reproduces asexually so every "tree" you touch is actually just one organism. If you try to dig up the roots you'll find that all the roots are connected together, showing it's all one organsim. 

Here is a diagram from the park of what this looks like:

*insert image here*

The tree has actually been around for years and spans quite a distance. 

Here is a picture with an outline of Pando:

But being surrounded by this tree gives the sense and feeling of being part of H.P. Lovecraft story where you enter, almost, the belly of the beast. And being surrounded by this large of a living organism is quite interesting
