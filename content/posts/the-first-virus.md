## Background

The idea of a self-replicating program was not a foreign concept at the time of the world's first computer virus called Creeper

## The World's First Computer Virus

The world's first well known computer virus was called Creeper and it was developed by a BBN programmer, Bob Thomas[^1]. Thomas initially created this virus as an experiment to test the idea of a self-replicating program, or worm. When Thomas had released it for testing he did not realize the extent to which his program would spread and found out quickly as his virus had quickly corrupted the DEC PDP-10 mainframe. After being corrupted these computers would go on to display a message saying "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!". Now is not really considered a malicious virus as the virus did not destroy or steal data and it only displayed a simple message.

Now how this virus worked was interesting by itself. The virus had caused the computer it was one to print a file, stop abruptly, find another Tenex computer, open a connection, then downloaded and transfer itself, and then start back up on the new system. The other interesting thing about this is that it did not really replicate itself. It almost shuffled from system to system displaying its message, thus not creating multiple instances of itself in the process[^1].

From the beginning of world seeing the effects of Creeper, it prompted research into preventing such programs for the future. As a result, the first anti-virus was created, known as Reaper, which was furthermore created to stop the Creeper virus[^1]. Little did the world know that this simple computer virus and anti-virus would be the start of the everlasting fight between malware developer and malware analyst.
