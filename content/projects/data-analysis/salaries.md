## Cybersecurity Salaries Data Analysis

The following is some data analysis I did on a dataset for cybersecurity salaries throughout the world. I wanted to find some interesting trends in the data that I had downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infosecjobs/global-salaries-in-cybersecurity-infosec/data) on Kaggle

Overall there were some interesting trends within the data and others that made sense. One of these observations was in salaries over time where USD salaries had increased over time. Along with this observation, I had went to ask the question of wether or not location mattered when it came to USD salaries. Although the location question may seem trival, the data seemed to be a little more complicated than that.

## Questions I Had Asked About the Data

- What are the mean and median of the USD salary?
  - If there is a difference between them, why is that that case?
- Does location, being remote, company size, employee residence, and/or company residence have a significance on USD salary?
    - What about with regular salary?
    - Are there certain factors that are stronger than others and if combined does that make the significance even stronger?

### Later on Questions

- Why is there such a disparity of data between USD and regular salary?
  - Is this how the dataset was collected?
  - What this because of currency conversions?
    - If so, what was the conversion at the time?
