This compatibility layer, called WOW64 (Windows-On-Windows 64-bit), allowed older software to function seamlessly. Underneath this compatibility abstraction, however, an opportunity emerged for attackers.
Security solutions frequently focused their defenses around 32-bit behaviors, neglecting less commonly exploited 64-bit operations. Heaven’s Gate was born from this oversight, enabling threat actors to break free from WOW64’s restrictions and execute unmonitored 64-bit code.</description></item><item><title>Black Hat Zig</title><link>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/black-hat-zig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/black-hat-zig/</guid><description>This project provides many malware techniques implementation using Zig since I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of it. You can use this repo to weaponize Zig. Black-Hat-Zig is continuously updating to make sure it contains as more content as it could. It will be perfect if you want to create a PR for this project.
Black Hat Zig This is a really neat project I found that&amp;rsquo;s using a new modern programming language called zig.</description></item></channel></rss>
