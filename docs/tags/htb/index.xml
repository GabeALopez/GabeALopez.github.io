Playbook gets more detailed later
Run nmap scan with following command: nmap -p- -sVC -vv &amp;lt;IP Addr&amp;gt; -oA enum/nmap Search on google for each port that is found on hacktricks for pentesting them Look for unusual ports that are not usually opened NOTE: Focus on ports other than port 80/443 first as 80/443 will take a longer time to enumerate
Overall for the ports I like to use https://book.</description></item></channel></rss>
