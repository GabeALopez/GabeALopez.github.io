Playbook gets more detailed later
Run nmap scan with following command: nmap -p- -sVC -vv &amp;lt;IP Addr&amp;gt; -oA enum/nmap Search on google for each port that is found on hacktricks for pentesting them Look for unusual ports that are not usually opened NOTE: Focus on ports other than port 80/443 first as 80/443 will take a longer time to enumerate
Overall for the ports I like to use https://book.</description></item><item><title>Red Team Tools</title><link>http://localhost:1313/projects/cybersecurity/list-of-red-team-tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/cybersecurity/list-of-red-team-tools/</guid><description>Hi there, here is a list of red team tools I have used in CTFs:
Directory Bruteforcing Feroxbuster - Recursive bruteforcing FUFF - Very flexible fuzzing tool Web Proxies Burpsuite - Most popular web proxy OWASP ZAP - Opensource alternative to Burpsuite Inspect Element - The ghetto web proxy Website Finger-Printing Tools Whatweb - A command line tool to help identify the backend and frontend of a website Wappalyzer - Works similarly to Whatweb but is a browser extension instead SQL Injection SQLmap - A nice tool to help automate discovering and exploiting SQL injections Cryptography CyberChef - Website based tool to help analyze and decrypt any encrypted text SMB Tools Crackmapexec - Post exploitation tool when you have found credentials on an SMB server Also a very helpful enumeration tool SMB Client - A local linux tool to use SMB shares Enum4linux - Automation tool to enumeration tool NOTE: In actual pentests it is advised to not really use this tool as it creates too much noise for the client NetExec - Another post exploitation tool for when you have credentials for an SMB server Active Directory Blood Hound - A nice enumeration tool when you have an initial shell on a windows machine This tools helps to produce a json file to import into the Blood Hound website so you can find a connection from your current user account to a domain admin</description></item></channel></rss>
