Explanation This project, as the description shows, was to teach new user to Unix/Linux systems the commands that they would be using in their day to day life. Many of these commands included &amp;rsquo;ls&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;cd&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;cat&amp;rsquo;, etc. However the interesting spin me and my team members had was that we designed as a puzzle game with a story added with it.
The puzzles would get progressively get harder and harder, trying to get the player to build upon what they had learned in the past.</description></item></channel></rss>
