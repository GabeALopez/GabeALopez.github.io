&lt;p>The following is some data analysis I did on a dataset for cybersecurity salaries throughout the world. I wanted to find some interesting trends in the data that I had downloaded &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infosecjobs/global-salaries-in-cybersecurity-infosec/data">here&lt;/a> on Kaggle&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall there were some interesting trends within the data and others that made sense. One of these observations was in salaries over time where USD salaries had increased over time. Along with this observation, I had went to ask the question of wether or not location mattered when it came to USD salaries. Although the location question may seem trival, the data seemed to be a little more complicated than that.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
