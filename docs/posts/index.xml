Welcome! Traveler I see you wish to hear about the greatness of automation! That&amp;rsquo;s good news. Well? Shall we begin? What is automation? I know I know you didn&amp;rsquo;t come here for a history lesson. Neither did I but this is to give you context to everything I will say. So don&amp;rsquo;t click away just yet. You hear me!?
Anyway automation, in todayâ€™s digital workflows, means using technology to handle repetitive tasks automatically.</description></item><item><title>The History of BonziBuddy</title><link>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/bonzibuddy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/bonzibuddy/</guid><description>Intro If you are like many you might be asking what the heck BonziBuddy is. Well to put it simply it was one of the virtual assistants that was created back in the day of Windows XP to help out with everyday office tasks. Many virtual assistants like BonziBuddy were created at the time since many users did not like current default implementation from Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s virtual assistant named clippy. Because of this many people created many differing virtual assistants that had extended upon what clippy could do.</description></item><item><title>The Birth of Computer Viruses: Origins and Evolution</title><link>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/the-first-virus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/the-first-virus/</guid><description>Self-Replicating Automata Now the idea of having a program replicate itself was, actually, not new. The first real theory of a self-replicating program starts in the 1940s with a mathematician named John von Neumann. His designs called for a universal separator, which builds the machine from a copier which replicated a machine&amp;rsquo;s description. The separation he called for allowed for mutations, enabling the new automata to evolve much like real organisms1.</description></item><item><title>The Origin of Hacking and the Evolution of it</title><link>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/the-start-of-hacking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/the-start-of-hacking/</guid><description>Introduction Originally hacking was never really attributed to the way the Hollywood portrays it today. In it&amp;rsquo;s more original state, hacking was making something happen that wasn&amp;rsquo;t intended to do. This meaning that to hack it to make a contraption do something that it was not intended to do or supposed to do in the first place.
For example, a drill is intended to be used to, well, drill holes and drill screws into walls.</description></item><item><title>The Eternalblue Story</title><link>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/eternal-blue/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/eternal-blue/</guid><description>Introduction The story of the eternalblue vulnerability is quite an interesting one as it comes back to the ever-recurring issue of government spying and whether or not the ends justify the means when it comes to government spying for the sake of protection.
Background Info Before getting into the events of what happened surrounding the discovery of the eternalblue vulnerability it is important to know what this vulnerability is in the first place.</description></item><item><title>Pando: The Trembling Giant</title><link>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/pando/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabealopez.github.io/posts/pando/</guid><description>Was made aware of a tree a few days ago by a friend. It is called Pando. It is apparently the world&amp;rsquo;s largest tree.
Here is a picture of it here:
It a tree that is located in Utah in the Fishlake National Forest and wasn&amp;rsquo;t realy recognized as a tree until 1976 when it rediscovered in a sense by two ecologists. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool to look at when you see in the Fall too, when its leaves change to a bright almost yellow-orange color.</description></item></channel></rss>
