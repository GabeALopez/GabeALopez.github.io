In it&rsquo;s more original state, hacking was making something happen that wasn&rsquo;t intended to do. This meaning that to hack it to make a contraption do something that it was not intended to do or supposed to do in the first place.</p><p>For example, a drill is intended to be used to, well, drill holes and drill screws into walls. Now what if someone took that same drill and used it instead as a way to spin a top fast. Now this wasn&rsquo;t the intended way of using the drill but you made this drill become the best top spinner in the world. Now in the case with computers, certain computers are designed to do a task, like holding data and restricting access to that data. But in the case of hacking, an attacker would make that computer show data to themselves that he does not have access to.</p><p>But hacking has gone a long way from what it&rsquo;s original definition used to be. In current time, it is attributed to malicious activities from hackers that wish to take for their personal gain. But this article is going to explore the differing types of &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; that was seen in the past. But this article will also lead up to more current ideas of &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; as well.</p><h2 id=the-simple-origins-of-hacking-as-a-concept>The Simple Origins of Hacking as a Concept</h2><p>One could argue that one of the original true forms of hacking were hacking of the law through loopholes and perverse incentives. Many people throughout the centuries have always tried to find ways of circumventing the law but circumventing the law in a way that is still considered &ldquo;legal&rdquo;. For example, in the case of the &ldquo;Whiskey Ring&rdquo; scandal in the 1870&rsquo;s, tax evasion and bribes to officials were conducted often. This scandal was able to function because of the loophole in how tax collection was conducted in US at the time<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, there are also &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; the government through perverse incentives as well. Which can occur due to government oversights in how certain programs give out rewards. Specifically, some programs in the past would offer rewards without really checking how the task was completed. An example of this can be seen in the &ldquo;Great Hanoi Rat Massacre of 1902&rdquo; where French colonial rule offered bounties based on the number of rats killed. However, rat catchers at the time would just cut off the tails of the rat and just send them back into the wild to breed more rats. This way, the catchers would gain more rat tails to sell back to the government<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><h2 id=cryptography>Cryptography</h2><p>Now previously, I&rsquo;ve talked about hacking being seen in exploiting how the law worked along with the people enforcing the law. But the next main part of the hacking that shows up in history is from cryptography. Throughout the centuries, people have been trying to encode and obfuscate messages and shows these encoded messages to their intended recipient without outside interference seeing what the message entails. An early example of such cryptographic techniques can be found in the time of Julius Caesar with his Caesar cipher.</p><p>For those who don&rsquo;t know what that is, it was a cipher that shifted the letters of a message by a given number of letters. For example, you take the phrase &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; and you shifted the letters by 6 you get &ldquo;Nkrru Cuxrj&rdquo;. Now this cipher had several issues with it. A few of the main issues being it&rsquo;s repeatability in the encrypted text and simplicity. But I will write an article about the history of cryptography in more detail in the future. But the important point about this cipher is that people went to work to crack this cipher and effectively hack it to receive the intended message. Time passed and the enlightenment era had begun, the Caesar Cipher had been broken by that time due the aforementioned reasons. Thus new technologies of cryptography were used and eventually cracked as well.</p><p>If you wish to learn more about the history of the Caesar Cipher, here is an article that I am using as a reference: <a href=https://caesar-cipher.com/history-evolution-caesar-cipher>link</a></p><p>Another instance of hacking a cipher in more recent time comparatively can be found in the instance of the Enigma Machine where during the second world war, Germans used it to encrypt the messages, orders, and other communications. The Polish first tried to break the code by using mathematical analysis to reduce the number of possible solutions that can be produced. Eventually until a codebreaker named Dilly Knox came upon the scene did he break the code using linguistic intuition about message format and content<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><h2 id=more-modern-times>More Modern Times</h2><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://www.history.com/news/the-whiskey-ring-and-americas-first-special-prosecutor>https://www.history.com/news/the-whiskey-ring-and-americas-first-special-prosecutor</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902>https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p><a href=https://www.historytools.org/inventions/the-complete-history-of-the-enigma-machine>https://www.historytools.org/inventions/the-complete-history-of-the-enigma-machine</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div><div class=prev-next></div><svg id="btt-button" class="arrow-logo" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 384 512" onclick="scrollToTop()" title="Go to top"><path d="M177 159.7l136 136c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6.0 33.9l-22.6 22.6c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9.0L160 255.9l-96.4 96.4c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9.0L7 329.7c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6.0-33.9l136-136c9.4-9.5 24.6-9.5 34-.1z"/></svg>
